# By default, consuming the theme as a gem leaves mermaid disabled; it is opt-in
mermaid:
  # Version of mermaid library
  # Pick an available version from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/
  version: "9.1.6"
  # Note: Put any additional configuration, such as setting the theme,
  #   in _includes/mermaid_config.js. See also docs/ui-components/code.
  # Note: To load mermaid from a local library, also use the `path` key
  #   to specify the location of the library; e.g. for (v10+):
  # path: "/assets/js/mermaid.esm.min.mjs" for (<v10):
  # path: "/assets/js/mermaid.min.js"
  # Note: copy both `mermaid.esm.min.mjs` (v10+) or `mermaid.min.js`
  #   (<v10) and the associated `.map` file from the specified version
  #   of `mermaid/dist` to `/assets/js/`.
