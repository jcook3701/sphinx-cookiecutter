## sphinx-cookiecutter CLA Privacy Policy

## Collection and storage of personal data and the nature and purpose of their use

Most Project business is conducted publicly, and privacy of submitted information is not expected.

Specifically, information is exchanged via public email lists and public code repositories. Public code repositories use patch submission, pull requests, discussions, and bug reports. None of these tools keep submitted information private. They are publicly accessible and archived in multiple locations around the world, by the Project and third parties.

You should never submit personally identifiable information (PII) via any of these mechanisms.

<!-- TODO: Think about creating a mailing list policy.

For more information on email lists, please see [Mailing List Policy]()
