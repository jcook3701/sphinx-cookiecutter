## Create a pull request

Every contribution to sphinx-cookiecutter's software begins with a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests/). This document guides you through the process of creating a PR.

## Before you begin

We know you're excited to create your first pull request. Before we get started, read these resources first:

- Get started [contributing to sphinx-cookiecutter]({{ site.repo_blob }}/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Make sure your code follows the relevant [style guides]({% link _manual/contribute/style-guides/index.md %}).
- It's recommended you [set up precommit hooks]({% link _manual/contribute/developer-guide.md %}) to auto-format when you commit.
