## Create a feature request

Feature requests help us understand what you need from sphinx-cookiecutter. This document guides you through writing effective feature requests that help maintainers understand your needs and prioritize improvements.

## Before you begin

We're excited to hear your ideas! Before you submit a feature request, consider these resources:

- Read the [Code of Conduct]({{ site.repo_blob }}/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to understand our community guidelines.
- Search [existing feature requests](https://github.com/jcook3701/sphinx-cookiecutter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atype%2Ffeature-request) to see if someone already suggested something similar.

## Your first feature request

When you're ready to submit a feature request, use the [feature request template](https://github.com/jcook3701/sphinx-cookiecutter/issues/new?template=02-feature-request.yml). The template has three sections that help maintainers understand what you need and why.

<!-- TODO: Put together an example feature request.

Here's an [example of how all three sections work together in an actual feature request](https://github.com/jcook3701/sphinx-cookiecutter) from the sphinx-cookiecutter community. We'll analyze each section based on this example feature request. -->

## Best practices for feature requests

Follow these guidelines to increase the chances of your feature request being accepted:

### Keep it focused

Request one feature at a time. If you have multiple ideas, create separate feature requests for each one. This makes it easier to discuss, prioritize, and implement each feature independently.

### Research first

Before submitting, search for similar requests. If you find an existing request that's close to your idea, add your use case and context to that discussion instead of creating a duplicate.

### Provide context

The more context you provide, the better maintainers can understand your needs. Include:

- Your environment or setup (which data sources, plugins, or features you're using)
- Your workflow or process
- Why this matters to you
- Any workarounds you've tried

### Be open to alternatives

Maintainers might suggest different approaches to solve your problem. Be open to these alternatives as they might be easier to implement or more maintainable in the long term.

### Stay engaged

After submitting your feature request, monitor the discussion. Answer questions from maintainers and provide clarification when needed. This helps move your request forward.

## Contributing the feature yourself

If you want to implement the feature yourself, feel free to create a pull request following the [pull request guidelines]({% link _manual/contribute/create-pull-request.md %}).

We welcome community contributions and appreciate your help making sphinx-cookiecutter better!
