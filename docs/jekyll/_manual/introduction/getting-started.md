## Getting started with sphinx-cookiecutter

1. [Requirements]({% link _manual/setup-guide/requirements.md %}) include python3, Nutri-Matic (docs & hooks), rust (rustup), and git-cliff (changelogs).
    * Python3 Packages
        1. [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) is required to utilize templates from github.  
        2. [Nutri-Matic](https://github.com/jcook3701/nutri-matic) is required to be sourced in python environment for template cookiecutter hooks to work.

I find that it easiest to clone the nutri-matic repository. Use the included makefile to install all python dependencies with ```make python-install``` from within the cloned directory.  Then, source the created file, ```.venv/bin/activate```, or point the below script variable, ```PYTHON_VENV```, to desired python virtual environment.  

### Examples

 Bash script can be copied and pasted into a shell file.  Then, used to begin generating new projects.  

__Template Options:__
* [cookiecutter-cookiecutter](https://github.com/jcook3701/cookiecutter-cookiecutter) to generate new cookiecutter template projects.
